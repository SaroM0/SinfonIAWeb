                <p class="paragraph-light">We are the robotics and AI research group at Universidad de Los Andes, a team passionate
                   about merging technology and human interaction. We currently work in the following subgroups: Perception, Navigation,
                    Manipulation and Speech, each of which refines a piece of the social interaction pie. Likewise, members in Interface
                     and Toolkit ensure that our robots are top-notch, while task members orchestrate the grand symphony of robotic tasks.
                      We are a multidisciplinary dream team, merging engineering prowess with the creative minds of several university
                       departments. Join us on this journey where technology and humanity come together to shape the future of robotics.</p>

        <h1>SinfonIA Foundation</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 14px;">This year marked the birth of SinfonIA, an exciting student initiative driven by its pioneers.
           The genesis of SinfonIA was driven by the arrival of a fascinating pepper robot named Opera,
            donated by Bancolombia in the SinfonIA alliance. This alliance, formed by the Universidad de los
             Andes, Universidad Santo Tomás and Universidad de Magdalena, is a collaboration between industry
              and academia to support the application and development of artificial intelligence and robotics
               in research projects.</p>

        <p>Our group has obtained a new member called Nova, a Pepper robot acquired entirely by the Universidad de Los Andes.
           Nova's arrival had a positive impact on several aspects, from improving our daily work to enhancing our research.
            In addition, he has brought his spark to the events in which we participate.</p>
